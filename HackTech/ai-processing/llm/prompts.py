	"volunteering": [text, text, /*...*/],
}


Format explanation:
- id - candidate id,
- name - name of the candidate,
- technical skills
	- hard skills, practical knowledge of the candidate, useful for completing tasks
	- you should deduct any hard skills from the entire CV, for example from work experience, projects, contests, education, etc.
- soft_skills
	- personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people
	- you should deduct any soft skills from the entire CV, for example from work experience, contests, volunteering, education, etc.
- education
	- high school diploma, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, PhD degree or others like this
- education
	- name - name of the institute and the degree
	- duration - for how long the candidate's education lasted
	- if the duration is not specified, you should deduct it from the CV (for instance, a Bachelor's degree is usually 4 years, a Master's is usually 2 years and so on)
- work_experience
	- name - function that the candidate had
	- duration - for how long the candidate had that function, in years (a float number with maximum 1 decimal point, for instance 1.5 years)
	- if work experience is not specified, you should deduct from the CV if the candidate had any work experience
	- in any case, if the duration is not specified, you should deduct it from the CV (for instance, if the role mentions "Junior", then work experience is at least 2 years, if "Senior", work experience is at least 5 years); you should be pessimistic with your approximation, giving the candidate the minimum time instead of the maximum time
- projects
	- any projects the candidate worked on, outside the work experience, education, contests or other sections
- contests
	- any contests the candidate participated in; you should also include here things like bootcamps, olympiads, hackathlons, workshops, talent shows etc.

	- for example: CAE, Google Cloud Security Expert, Python Basics, AutoCAD, Project Management etc. 
- foreign_languages:
	- name of language and level (C1, C2, Profficiency, Advanced, A1, Elementary etc.)
	- if the level is not specified, you should assign a medium level, and if English is specified as a language, you should assess the level from the way the CV is written (if the CV is in English)
- volunteering:
	- where the candidate had volunteering experience

domain_1 = '''
Assess the candidate's experience in the industry relevant to the job requirement by following a detailed evaluation process.

Given a job position description and a CV, evaluate the candidate's experience with emphasis on industry relevance and time spent in the industry. Focus on the sections of the CV in the specific order provided while ignoring irrelevant sections. 

### Steps

1. **Study the Job Position Description:**
   - Understand the industry and specific job requirements.
   - Note the key responsibilities, required qualifications, and preferred skills listed.

2. **Analyze the CV:**
   - Prioritize sections of the CV in the following order for relevance: `work_experience`, `projects`, `certifications`, `education` (note the variety, not duration), and `contests`.
   - Identify mentions of industries relevant to the job position.

3. **Assess Experience Relevance and Duration:**
   - Consider the match between the candidate's experience and the job's industry.
   - Evaluate the time spent in relevant industry roles, except for `education` where variety of diplomas matters over duration.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - Determine a score between 0 and 100 based on industry alignment and relevant experience.
   - Take into account both qualitative industry fit and quantitative duration.

5. **Provide Reasoning:**
   - Write a concise 2-3 sentence explanation for the score.

tehnical_skills_2 = '''
Analyze a candidate's CV to evaluate their experience with specific skills listed in a job position description and score it from 0 to 100.

A detailed breakdown of the scoring process and important details are provided below.

- **CV Assessment**: Interpret the candidate's CV to extract relevant skills information. Evaluate the candidate’s work experience, technical skills, certifications, project involvement, and education linked to each skill listed in the job position's 'hr_requirements'.
  
- **Component Scores**:
  - **S1**: Evaluate work experience based on the number of years and job title. Assign points according to the level of the role (junior, mid, senior) and duration.
  - **S2**: Assess the weight of the skill in `technical_skills`.
  - **S3**: Consider any certifications, assigning points according to their level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert).
  - **S4**: Count relevant projects, evaluating them as basic, intermediate, or very advanced.
  - **S5**: Consider education related to the skill, scoring based on the degree level (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).

- **Final Score Calculation**: Utilize the formula $13 \times S1 + 5 \times S2 + 3 \times S3 + 3 \times S4 + 2 \times S5$. Normalize the score to ensure it's between 0 and 100.

- **Reasoning**: Provide a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) for the given score, detailing the assessment process and key factors influencing the score.

### Output Format

The output must be a JSON object containing the job ID, CV ID, calculated score, and reasoning text.

``` json
{
	"job_id": text,
	"cv_id": text,
	"score": number,  // integer between 0 and 100
	"reasoning": text  // short reasoning of why the score is like this
}
```

### Steps

1. **Extract Information**: Identify relevant skills from the candidate's CV that match the job position's 'hr_requirements'.
2. **Calculate Component Scores**: Determine S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 based on CV content.
3. **Compute Final Score**: Use the given formula to calculate the final score.
4. **Normalize Score**: Adjust the final score to fall between 0 and 100.
5. **Draft Reasoning**: Write a concise and specific reasoning for the score.

### Notes

- Consider edge cases, such as candidates lacking formal education or certifications, by focusing more on applicable experience and project involvement.
- Ensure accuracy in matching skill names and proficiency levels against the job requirements.
- Utilize qualitative judgment where precise numeric equivalences for skills or roles may not be provided in the CV.

general_match_prompt_3 = '''
Analyze a job position description and a candidate's CV to calculate a suitability score for the job.

Utilize the steps provided to systematically evaluate the job requirements and the candidate's qualifications, calculating percentages and scores according to the predefined method.

### Steps

1. **Analyze Job Requirements:**
   - Extract and list all qualifications and skills from `required_qualifications` and `preferred_skills`.
   - Evaluate their importance using `key_responsibilities` as well as other sections of the job description.
   - Assign percentages to each requirement, totaling 100%. Ensure that`required_qualifications` have more weight than `preferred_skills`.

2. **Assess Candidate's CV:**
Analyze the CV of the candidate and search for the qualifications and skills found and weighted at step 1. Asses the experience of the candidate with each of those skills and score them from 0 to 100. The scoring of one skill is calculated by composing multiple scores, which should be assessed by you as well:
        - S1: Work experience using the skill, assessed by the number of years and job title. 1 year of work experience in a junior role using that skill is 3 points. 1 year of work experience in a mid role using that skill is 5 points. 1 year of work experience in a senior role using that skill is 8 points. So, if the candidate worked 2 years as junior with that skill, the score should be 6 and if they worked 2 years as junior, 2 as mid and 1 as senior with that skill, the score should be 24.
	- S2: Weight of that skill mentioned in `technical_skills`
	- S3: Certification of that skill. If the certification is of beginner type, it counts as 1 point, if it is of intermediate type, it counts as 5 points, if it is of advanced type, it counts as 8 points and if it is of expert type, it counts as 13 points
	- S4 : number of projects with that skill; if the project is basic, it should count as 3 points, if the project is intermediate it should count as 8 points and if the project is very advanced, it should count as 13 points
	- S5: education in the domain of the skill; a high school diploma in a domain that is tangent with that skill counts as 1 point, a Bachelor's Degree counts as 3 points, a Master's Degree counts as 8 points and a PhD counts as 13 points
	- The formula for the final score at step 2 (for one skill) is $13\times S1 + 5 \times S2 + 3 \times S3 + 3 \times S4 + 2 \times S5$, and the score must be normalized to be between 0 and 100.
   
3. **Weighted Average Calculation:**
   - Compute a weighted average of the skill scores found at step 2 using the weights assigned in step 1.

4. **Adjust for Expertise Levels:**
        There are 3 usual levels of expertise in job descriptions: junior (0-2 years of experience), mid (2-5 years of experience), senior (5+ years of experience). If the distance between the job requirement expertise and candidate's expertise is 0, the score at step 3 should be left as it is. If the distance is 1, the score should be divided by 2 and if the distance is 2, the score should be divided by 5. For example, a job for a mid level and  a mid level CV should not downweight the score, a job for a junior and a CV of a senior should downweight the score by a factor of 5 and a job for a senior or junior and a CV of a mid should downweight the score by a factor of 2.

### Output Format

Provide the result in JSON format as follows:
``` json
{
	"job_id": text,
	"cv_id": text,
	"score": number,  // integer between 0 and 100
	"reasoning": text  // short reasoning of why the score is like this
}
```

### Notes

- Ensure all calculations are correct and based on the inputs provided.
- The reasoning should provide a clear understanding of how the score was derived.
- Address any discrepancies in the expertise levels carefully to maintain accuracy in scoring.

### Important

- Ensure the output is valid and it is not empty.
